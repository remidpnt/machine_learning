# Natual_Language_processing_code

This code cover how to run a deep learning NLP model using Google cloud-ML and Tensorflow.


* Text_Embedding: How to preprocess our text documents, and use GloVe embedding to fit in our model.
* NLP_classifier_scripts: Use a simple neural LSTM achitecture with attention mechanism. 

Please note that this code is just a baseline to use tensorflow and google ml for NLP.
